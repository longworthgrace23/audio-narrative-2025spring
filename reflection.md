# Audio Narrative Reflection

### Origins

This project’s origin is somewhat ironic. I find that my best ideas come to me when I let my mind wander, so I sat down in front of a blank Google doc and jotted down every half-baked idea that I could come up with. I was unintentionally focusing on ideas related to politics, probably because of the unending stream of headlines that could conceivably have come from The Onion over the last few weeks. As a political science major and student journalist, these issues and bits of news have been top of mind for me recently. As I was brainstorming, I kept coming back to the scariest things I had seen in the news that day, causing me to become anxious and giving me less control over the thoughts my brain produced next. I began to spiral, similarly to what you hear at the very end of this narrative. When I snapped out of it, I realized that what I just experienced could be reproduced sonically and serve as a compelling, and perhaps therapeutic, outlet to express my own worries, ones that I’m sure other college students could relate to. And thus, I got to work on *Echo Chamber.*

### Layer 1: Background

To start, I spent a day recording short snippets of typical sounds from my apartment and the environment on Pitt’s campus. To make things a little easier on myself for creating the portion of my day I spent away from home, I decided to record a voice memo of myself walking from our classroom in Cathy to another classroom in Posvar. It ended up being about seven minutes of audio from which I pulled the crosswalk signal on Forbes, Posvar’s metal door and elevator, and almost all of the background for the last minute or so of the narrative. With this foundation, I filled any gaps with clips I found on Freesound. This included the distinct sound of a digital alarm clock and the sound of voices behind my keyboard clacks – I wanted to avoid trying to capture those sounds myself in case I accidentally caught something audible in a classmate’s conversation. The screenshot below shows how I split these clips up and spaced them out to create the first layer of my narrative. Almost all of my feedback recommended reducing the noise level of the two overlapping tracks shown here, so the final product doesn’t include the “footsteps” clip. (I found when editing that the traffic sounds somehow weren’t the culprit; the salt crunching on the sidewalk was creating too much feedback!)

There were a few other clips that were either too loud or too quiet, which I fixed during the revision process by familiarizing myself with Audacity’s limiter, amplifier, and loudness normalization effects. This screenshot shows the end result of a brief section after spending an in-class studio day messing with these effects and attempting to regulate the volume of each clip across the background track.

During the process of piecing together my background layer, I had a hard time deciding whether to try and blend the clips together into a seamless flow or intentionally leave them chopped up. I felt that the repeated cuts were less pleasant to listen to, but simultaneously conveyed the fast pace of my day and indicated my tendency to always keep things moving and not take time to relax or settle, eventually building up to what happens in the end. While I do think blending the clips together would have made the narrative nicer to hear, I’m ultimately happy with the way I left it for the sake of the message I wanted to get across. 

### Layer 2: Narration

My next step was to record my own voice for the narration. I intended to knock this out in one go, but I ended up coming up with new ideas for clips sporadically and recording them as I went. The most challenging part of this layer was finding an effect that made it clear that they were thoughts, not spoken out loud. I spent some time experimenting with Audacity’s presets and landed on a reverb as the best option. I then had to do some research into what each individual setting (like room size, damping, etc.) was for. I found that increasing the room size and decreasing the reverberance from their defaults achieved the spacey, lofty effect I was envisioning. Based on feedback I received from David and Maddie (pictured second), listeners perceived the effect the way I hoped they would. Pictured below is a screenshot I took when I decided on the settings I wanted and saved them as a user preset:

### Layer 3: Static

The final layer of my narrative was the static, white noise-type sound heard underneath my rambling thoughts toward the end. I downloaded three clips from Freesound to test out, intending to choose one. I found that just one didn’t quite achieve the tension I was looking for, so I ended up layering all three over each other. I applied a fade in effect to all three, having them peak and cut off at the same moment as my speech. Originally, I had chosen one of the three to extend out for a second or two past that point with a fade out effect, intending to replicate a ringing-in-the-ears sort of sound. Several pieces of feedback I received, however, indicated that that choice took away from the intensity of the hard cut, so I adjusted by removing it and amplifying the underlying sound as it built up to the cut. Pictured below are those bits of feedback.

### Criteria + Conclusion

As far as the criteria for this project, I would say I met all of the baseline points. It runs for a little over two minutes, my location changes from home to campus, I have originally recorded and online-sourced clips, my repo includes a credits.md file listing the sources I found online with my permissions to use them, and my tracks overlap in three places more than once. I believe I have also met a few of the aspirational criteria. For example, the organization scheme I chose (choppy, separated clips) was intentional and articulated earlier in this reflection. Further, my repo will show the meaningful commit messages I wrote throughout the process, as well as a detailed transcript of my narrative. Workshop feedback shown earlier confirms that the audience interpreted certain aspects of my project the way I intended. Finally, all of Audacity’s features and tools were new to me since I hadn’t worked with the software before, but I specifically focused on and got familiar with the reverb effect and how the limiter/amplifier effects interacted with the loudness normalization effect. 

Overall, I really enjoyed working on this project and learning how to use Audacity. I am happy with the work I put in and the final result!

# Preview (1/28)

### Narrative Preview

The progress I have made so far is mostly in the background layers of my narrative. It includes typical sounds associated with the steps of my morning routine, my commute to campus, and the environment of my classrooms. I have spent the last few days recording the mundane parts of my day that I wasn’t thinking about when I first thought through my concept of this project, like the sound of me switching my lights on first thing in the morning. This preview lays out a decent sonic foundation for the physical parts of my narrative – the parts that signal which part of my day I’m moving through and where I am at those times. Right now, they are just laid out in order but not necessarily spaced out the way they will end up in the final product. The length of my narration clips will determine that aspect.

In the coming days, I plan to work more intricately with these background clips. Specifically, I want to examine where I might be able to add personal details that provide glimpses into what a day in **my** life looks like (as opposed to a day in **a** life). Further, I’m hoping to explore the options that Audacity provides to add depth and distance to some of these clips. For example, I might try using clips I captured of traffic on Forbes Avenue to create the sonic effect of a car moving past me (moving the sound from one side of the speaker to the other).

Other next steps will include building up the foreground of the narrative – the non-physical setting I mentioned in my proposal. I will record the narration that I have scripted and work on implementing them in effective places within the context provided by the background. Eventually, those bits of narration will overlap and take over the soundscape, causing the background of my day to drown out. Right now, that plan only exists in my head – I’m still thinking through what that will look and sound like in Audacity. I may end up needing some kind of basic, ignorable, consistent sound to ground my “spiralling” narration. I will cross that bridge when I get to it, but I will probably experiment with white noise, static, buzzing, and muffled shouting to achieve the effect I’m imagining.

### Audio Narrative Proposal

My audio narrative will revolve around a day in the life of an anxious overthinker. My tentative plan is to spend a day recording short clips of my typical routine. I’m hoping to capture sounds like brewing coffee, shutting and locking the front door, and the ambience of footsteps and traffic on campus and around South Oakland. These assets, among others, will make up the background of my soundscape. My voice will interject with questions and anxious thoughts throughout. An example might be: “Did I remember to lock the front door?” These will start out infrequent and mostly harmless, then pick up in frequency and intensity toward the end to signify a sort of spiral. Eventually, my interjections will overlay each other and drown out the background noise of my day. While the physical setting of the narrative will be Pitt’s campus, the interpretive setting will be my/the narrator’s mind, which I will aim to convey through a slight distortion effect on my bits of narration.

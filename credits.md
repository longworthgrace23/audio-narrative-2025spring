### Audio Narrative Proposal

My audio narrative will revolve around a day in the life of an anxious overthinker. My tentative plan is to spend a day recording short clips of my typical routine. I’m hoping to capture sounds like brewing coffee, shutting and locking the front door, and the ambience of footsteps and traffic on campus and around South Oakland. These assets, among others, will make up the background of my soundscape. My voice will interject with questions and anxious thoughts throughout. An example might be: “Did I remember to lock the front door?” These will start out infrequent and mostly harmless, then pick up in frequency and intensity toward the end to signify a sort of spiral. Eventually, my interjections will overlay each other and drown out the background noise of my day. While the physical setting of the narrative will be Pitt’s campus, the interpretive setting will be my/the narrator’s mind, which I will aim to convey through a slight distortion effect on my bits of narration.

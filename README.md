This site houses an audio narrative project by student Grace Longworth for an English composition class, Composing Digital Media, taught by professor Ben Miller at the University of Pittsburgh.

This audio narrative, entitled Echo Chamber, walks the listener through a fast-paced day in my life as an overthinker. Throughout the narrative, my mind races and produces a flow of anxiety-inducing thoughts, culminating in a mental spiral. It was inspired by lived experience that I think many of us can relate to in the age of doomscrolling and new once-in-a-century historical events making headlines every week.
